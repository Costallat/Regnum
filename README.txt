If you want better tools and/or to upgrade them, Regnum is the right choice for you.
With Regnum you can get very fast tools. Some tools can double your ores when you dig for them.
You have to craft more then 120 battleaxes to get the best one. The Regnum battle-axe!
Only simple things are needed to upgrade your tools. Dirt, cobble…but you need lots of it.
Or you need some new ores such as uranium, titanium or more then 20 others.
Dig up uranium and you get green experience. Dig up a red or blue ore and you get red or blue experience.
Get the highest level, the xp key, the craft key or the bag key.
With the craft key you can craft 4x4.
Look with the xp key for all xp you need.
Get coins, laser-guns and many other rewards
Get a gift from 4 mobs.
More then 1800 different blocks, items, tools and lots more.
It will take a long time before you get the regnum battle-axe, the highest level, all keys,8 Regnum bags and the best armor
